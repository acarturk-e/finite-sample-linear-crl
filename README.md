# Sample complexity of interventional causal representation learning -- Experiment codes

Requires Python version > 3.11, and external libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

To run the experiments, run file `finite_sample_test.py`. To obtain figures in lieu of what is reported in paper, run the file `finite_sample_analysis.py` -- see the comments therein for details.

The algorithms described in our paper are implemented in file `finite_sample_algos.py`.

Some portions of this code base are taken from the experiment code of [1] with author's permission.
